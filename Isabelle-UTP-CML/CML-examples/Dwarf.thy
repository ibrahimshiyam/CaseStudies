subsubsection {* Dwarf Signal Types *}

text {* A \emph{Dwarf Signal} is a kind of railway signal which is
used at the side of a track when space is limited. An illustration is
shown in Figure \ref{fig:dwarfsignal}. It has three lamps which are
displayed in different configurations to give instructions to train
drivers. The signal's three lamps are named L1--L3, as illustrated,
and different configurations of a signal can be written using set
notation, for instance this signal is in $\{L1, L2\}$ which means
\textbf{Stop}. We begin by setting up three abbreviations to represent
these three strings. *}

abbreviation "L1 \<equiv> ''L1''"
abbreviation "L2 \<equiv> ''L2''"
abbreviation "L3 \<equiv> ''L3''"

text {* Next we start to construct the basic types for the Dwarf
signal, including the \texttt{LampId}, an enumeration of the three
signal states, and \texttt{Signal} which a (finite) set of
\texttt{LampId}s.*}

abbreviation "LampId   \<equiv> \<parallel><L1> | <L2> | <L3>\<parallel>"
abbreviation "Signal   \<equiv> \<parallel>@set of @LampId\<parallel>"

text {* The signal has a total of four \emph{proper states} which are
the well-defined commands a signal can convey to a driver. When all
lamps are off (indicated by the empty set $\{\}$) the signal is in the
\textbf{Dark} state, which is a power saving mode for when the signal
is not in use. The three remaining proper states \textbf{Stop},
\textbf{Warning} and \textbf{Drive} are indicated by a combination of
two lamps and correspond to the positions of an old-style semaphore
signal. We define these possible values below: *}

definition "dark     \<equiv> +|{}|+"
definition "stop     \<equiv> +|{<L1>, <L2>}|+"
definition "warning  \<equiv> +|{<L1>, <L3>}|+"
definition "drive    \<equiv> +|{<L2>, <L3>}|+"

text {* We also add the definitional equations for these values to the
evaluation tactics, so that proofs can be performed about them: *}

declare dark_def [eval,evalp]
declare stop_def [eval,evalp]
declare warning_def [eval,evalp]
declare drive_def [eval,evalp]

text {* Next we set up the datatype for proper states. It consists of
a signal which is in one of the four states: \textbf{Dark},
\textbf{Stop}, \textbf{Warning} and \textbf{Drive}, specified through
an invariant. *}

abbreviation 
  "ProperState \<equiv> 
     \<parallel>@Signal 
      inv ps == (&ps in @set {&dark, &stop, &warning, &drive})\<parallel>"

text {* We then create a datatype to represent the state of the entire
Dwarf Signal, which we specify as a CML record. Setting up a record
type is currently a little complicated, though the CML tool
automatically generates them. First we create a new unit type to act
as the "tag" for this record so that it can be distinguished from
others. We create an instance of the tag class which requires that we
prove it's a unit type and associate a string with it (the name of the
type). *}

typedef DwarfType_Tag = "{True}" by auto
instantiation DwarfType_Tag :: tag

definition "tagName_DwarfType_Tag (x::DwarfType_Tag) = ''DwarfType''"
instance 
  by ( intro_classes
     , metis (full_types) Abs_DwarfType_Tag_cases singleton_iff)
end

text {* Next we create a collection of fields associated with the
        tag. The @{term MkField} function constructs a record field
        from a record tag, position in the field and a CML type. There
        are six fields in \texttt{DwarfType}. *}

abbreviation "lastproperstate_fld \<equiv> 
  MkField TYPE(DwarfType_Tag) #1 \<parallel>@ProperState\<parallel>"

abbreviation "desiredproperstate_fld \<equiv> 
  MkField TYPE(DwarfType_Tag) #2 \<parallel>@ProperState\<parallel>"

abbreviation "turnoff_fld \<equiv> 
  MkField TYPE(DwarfType_Tag) #3 \<parallel>@set of @LampId\<parallel>"

abbreviation "turnon_fld \<equiv> 
  MkField TYPE(DwarfType_Tag) #4 \<parallel>@set of @LampId\<parallel>"

abbreviation "laststate_fld \<equiv> 
  MkField TYPE(DwarfType_Tag) #5 \<parallel>@Signal\<parallel>"

abbreviation "currentstate_fld \<equiv> 
  MkField TYPE(DwarfType_Tag) #6 \<parallel>@Signal\<parallel>"

text {* Then we use these fields to create selector functions for the record, which
        can be used directly in UTP/CML predicates. *}

abbreviation "turnoff \<equiv> SelectRec turnoff_fld"
abbreviation "turnon \<equiv> SelectRec turnon_fld"
abbreviation "laststate \<equiv> SelectRec laststate_fld"
abbreviation "currentstate \<equiv> SelectRec currentstate_fld"

text {* Finally we create the actual type by giving the list of fields
        and the associated invariant. We also create a record
        constructor, \texttt{mk\_DwarfType}. *}

subsubsection {* Actions *}

text {* With the state and operations for the Dwarf signal specified
we can proceed to define the reactive components of the the Dwarf
process. We first create an action called \texttt{DWARF}, which can
perform several behaviours. If a message is received on channel
\texttt{light}, the \texttt{TurnOn} operation is executed with the
given lamp, and the action then recurses. If a message is received on
the \texttt{extinguish} channel, the given lamp is extinguished. If a
message is received on \texttt{setPS}, a new proper state is
selected. Additionally the Dwarf signal is always capable of
communicating its current state on the \texttt{shine} channel -- this
can be seen as observing the signal. *}



definition 
  "DWARF = `init -> (Init() ; 
       (\<mu> DWARF. 
          (((light?(l) -> TurnOn(&l)) ; DWARF) 
       [] ((extinguish?(l) -> TurnOff(&l)); DWARF)
       [] ((setPS?(s) -> SetNewProperState(&s)); DWARF)
       [] (shine!(($dw).currentstate) -> DWARF))))`"

text {* Next we define some simple test actions for the Dwarf
signal. The first is a working test which, when composed with the
\texttt{DWARF} action, will cause the signal to transition, first to
\texttt{warning}, and then to \texttt{drive}, turning appropriate
lights on and off on the way. This is a valid behaviour. *}

text {* Working test *}
definition
  "TEST1 = `setPS!&warning -> extinguish!<L2> -> light!<L3> 
         -> setPS!&drive -> extinguish!<L1> -> light!<L2> -> STOP`"

text {* The second test tries to turn on 3 lights simulaneously. This
violates the \texttt{NeverShowAll} invariant. *}

definition
  "TEST2 = `setPS!&warning -> light!<L3> -> extinguish!<L2> 
         -> setPS!&drive -> extinguish!<L1> -> light!<L2> -> STOP`"

text {* The third test tries to go straight from \textsf{dark} to \textsf{warning}, which
violates the \texttt{DarkOnlyToStop} variant. *}

definition
  "TEST3 = `setPS!&dark -> extinguish!<L1> -> extinguish!<L2> 
           -> setPS!&warning -> light!<L1> -> light!<L2> -> STOP`"

text {* The fourth test action tries to go from stop to drive, which violates the
\texttt{ForbidStopToDrive} invariant. *}

definition
  "TEST4 = `setPS!&drive -> extinguish!<L1> -> light!<L3> -> STOP`"

text {* We can execute these tests by composing them with the
\texttt{DWARF} action, which is done below: *}

definition "DWARF_CHAN = {setPS\<down>,light\<down>,extinguish\<down>}"

definition "DWARF_TEST1 = `DWARF [|DWARF_CHAN|] TEST1`"
definition "DWARF_TEST2 = `DWARF [|DWARF_CHAN|] TEST2`"
definition "DWARF_TEST3 = `DWARF [|DWARF_CHAN|] TEST3`"
definition "DWARF_TEST4 = `DWARF [|DWARF_CHAN|] TEST4`"

text {* Finally we specify the main action of this process. It waits
for an initialisation signal, sets the initial state for the Dwarf
signal and then enters the main event loop. \texttt{DWARF} could also
be substituted with one of the tests above, to explore a particular
behaviour of the system. *}

  "MainAction = `init -> (Init() ; DWARF)`"
